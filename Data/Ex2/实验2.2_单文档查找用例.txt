It is now recognized that real world phenomena that are subject to short-term perturbations
whose duration is negligible in comparison with the duration of the process are more accurately
described using impulsive differential equations. See, for example, and the refer ences cited therein.
Also in certain circumstances, the future state of a physical system depends not only on the present state
but also on its past history.
Thus incorporating delay in the different tial equations ensures a better model of the process involved.
